				                   Meeting (JUNE 13th 2015)
	
Following are important points discussed in the meeting.

1.	Only goal or task oriented functionalities to be included in the app. Keep in mind the theme or “purpose” of the app while including even the smallest new feature. 
2.	App should also be able to adapt according to the number of calls by a user to a particular contact. 
        Eg: if a user calls a particular contact frequently in current week, then app should “increase the level” of that contact to more frequently contacted list for next week.
3.	In person conversations to be done.
4.	Deadlines to be set in the next week.
5.	Switching of team leads every week. 
6.	From 21st June (until 3 weeks), remain connected by uploading every document in GITHUB.
7.	Development Process :
        Name | Development | Quality Assurance
        Either Divyajeet develops the code and Neha tests or vice versa(switch the roles on timely basis).
8.	Make sure code review is done and deciding on how to finish the parts together.
